# ‚ú® lic-ast-condo-sales-analysis ‚ú®

Welcome to the `lic-ast-condo-sales-analysis` repository\! üèôÔ∏è This project delves into residential condo sales data for two dynamic neighborhoods in Queens, New York City: **Long Island City (LIC)** and **Astoria**. Using publicly available real estate transaction data, we aim to uncover insights into market trends, property values, and price per square foot.

Whether you're a real estate enthusiast, a data science learner, or just curious about NYC property, this repository offers a ready-to-use analytical pipeline.

## üöÄ Features

  * **Data Loading & Initial Exploration:** Effortlessly load raw sales data from CSV and get a quick overview.
  * **Robust Data Cleaning:** Automate the cleaning process by dropping irrelevant columns and converting data types for better analysis. üßπ
  * **Neighborhood-Specific Processing:** Focus on specific areas (LIC and Astoria) to analyze their unique market dynamics, filtering by relevant property types and sale conditions.
  * **Address Standardization**: Cleans and standardizes address formats for better consistency.
  * **External Data Integration:** Leverage the Socrata Open Data API to fetch crucial **Gross Square Footage (SQFT)** information for individual units, enhancing the accuracy of price calculations. üìä
  * **Price Per Square Foot Calculation:** Compute a standardized metric ($$/SQFT$) to compare property values across different units and neighborhoods.
  * **Outlier Handling**: Implements basic filtering to focus on a reasonable range of price per square foot values for more meaningful statistical descriptions and visualizations.
  * **Data Export:** Export processed and enriched dataframes to CSV for further analysis or visualization. üíæ

## üìä Data Sources

This analysis relies on data from two primary sources:

  * **NYC Department of Finance (DOF) Rolling Sales Data:** The initial sales transaction data (`2020-2025.csv`) is sourced from the NYC Department of Finance, providing details on property sales, addresses, and prices. You can typically find this data on the [NYC.gov website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/property/property-rolling-sales-data.page).
  * **NYC Department of Finance (DOF) - Property Valuation and Assessment Data Tax Classes 1,2,3,4 (Socrata API):** We utilize the [NYC OpenData portal's Property Valuation and Assessment Data Tax Classes 1,2,3,4](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Property-Valuation-and-Assessment-Data-Tax-Classes/8y4t-faws/about_data) via its Socrata API to programmatically retrieve gross square footage for specific apartment units based on address and apartment number.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

To get started with this analysis, follow these steps:

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thexqin/lic-ast-condo-sales-analysis.git
cd lic-ast-condo-sales-analysis
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas requests sodapy matplotlib
```

### 3\. Obtain a Socrata APP\_TOKEN

To use the Socrata API for fetching square footage data, you'll need an **APP TOKEN**.

  * Go to the [NYC OpenData website](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/).
  * Sign up for a free account.
  * Generate an App Token (usually found in your profile settings or when accessing API documentation).

Once you have your `APP_TOKEN`, you'll need to use it in the notebook. **For security, avoid hardcoding it directly in public repositories.** While the provided notebook code uses `APP_TOKEN` directly, in a production setting, you would load this from an environment variable or a secure configuration file.

### 4\. Place Your Data

Make sure your `2020-2025.csv` file (containing the NYC DOF sales data) is in the root directory of the cloned repository.

### 5\. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open and run the Jupyter notebook (`lic_ast_condo_sales_analysis.ipynb`) in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, VS Code with Python extension).

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Execute each cell sequentially. The notebook will:

  * Load and clean the sales data.
  * Process data specifically for Long Island City and Astoria.
  * Call the Socrata API to enrich the data with square footage.
  * Calculate and display price per square foot.
  * Export the refined data to `2019-2025-lic.csv` and `2019-2025-ast.csv`.

## üìà Insights & Visualizations

The analysis culminates in valuable metrics like the average price per square foot for condos in LIC and Astoria. Box plots are generated to help visualize the distribution of these values, identify typical price ranges, and spot any outliers.

### Long Island City (LIC) 2019-2025 $/SQFT

This plot shows the distribution of price per square foot for condo sales in Long Island City from 2019 to 2025.

### Astoria (AST) 2019-2025 $/SQFT

This plot illustrates the distribution of price per square foot for condo sales in Astoria from 2019 to 2025.

These visualizations help in understanding the typical value range and spread of condo prices in each neighborhood, with the central line indicating the median, the box showing the interquartile range, and the "whiskers" extending to show variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. Outlier points are individually marked.

## üí° Conclusion from the Analysis

Based on the processed sales data from 2019 to 2025, focusing on residential condominiums (Building Class R4) with valid sale prices and successfully integrated square footage data, we observed the following:

  * **Long Island City (LIC)** exhibited a higher median price per square foot ($/SQFT) of approximately **$1396** based on a sample of 728 transactions within a reasonable $/SQFT range ($500 - $4000).
  * **Astoria** showed a lower median price per square foot of around **$1177** based on a sample of 308 transactions within a defined $/SQFT range ($500 - $2400).

This suggests that, on average, condominiums in LIC commanded a premium in terms of price per square foot compared to Astoria during the analyzed period. This could be attributed to various factors such as proximity to Manhattan, newer developments, and local amenities. However, it's important to note that this analysis provides a general overview, and further granular analysis considering factors like specific building characteristics, location within the neighborhood, and time trends would offer a more comprehensive understanding of the market dynamics.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

  * Explore time-based trends in sales prices and price per square foot.
  * Analyze the impact of building age and other property features on sale prices.
  * Conduct more detailed geographical analysis within each neighborhood.
  * Incorporate additional datasets, such as demographic information or economic indicators, to provide richer insights.
